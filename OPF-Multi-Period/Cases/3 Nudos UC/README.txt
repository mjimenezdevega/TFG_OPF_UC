A three-bus problem with Unit Commitment has been modeled. Bus 1 includes an equivalent solar generator, 
while Bus 2 contains a gas generator with intertemporal constraints, both connected to Bus 3, 
which hosts the system demand. The analysis focuses on the impact of these constraints on system cost 
and renewable curtailment
