This is an extension of the '3-Bus UC' case. Bus 1 contains a solar generator, 
Bus 2 includes both a gas generator and a biomass generator, and Bus 3 hosts a wind generator. 
Unlike the original setup, demand is now present at all buses, which are interconnected by 
three transmission lines (1–2, 2–3, and 3–1). In this case, we study how the intertemporal constraints of
both thermal generators, as well as the power flow limits of the transmission lines, affect system operation.
